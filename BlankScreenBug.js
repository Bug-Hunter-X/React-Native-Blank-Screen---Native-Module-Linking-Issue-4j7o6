This error occurs when you are using a library or component that requires native modules, but these modules are not properly linked or installed.  This often happens with third-party libraries that aren't fully compatible with your React Native setup, or when you've encountered issues during the build process. The symptoms often include completely blank screens or components failing to render without any clear error messages in the console.
