# React Native Blank Screen Bug

This repository demonstrates a common React Native bug where a blank screen appears due to a problem linking native modules. The bug is reproduced in `BlankScreenBug.js`, and the solution is provided in `BlankScreenSolution.js`.

**Bug:** The app compiles without errors, but displays a blank screen. This usually suggests a native module issue, possibly due to a missing dependency or an error during the linking process.

**Solution:** Thoroughly check your native module installations using react-native link or manual linking process. Ensure that all platform-specific dependencies are installed and configured correctly. Double-check that your environment variables, native code dependencies, and build processes are set up correctly.  Specific steps are described in `BlankScreenSolution.js`.
