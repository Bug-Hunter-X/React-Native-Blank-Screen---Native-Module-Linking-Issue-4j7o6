The solution involves verifying and correcting the linking of native modules.  Ensure that you have correctly linked the required native modules using either the `react-native link` command (if the library supports it), or by manually linking the native code in both Android and iOS projects.  Thoroughly check your package.json for the correct dependencies.  Additionally review the build system to ensure that all native dependencies are correctly included. For example: 

```javascript
// Verify library installation and linking
// ... check installation
// ... check android/app/build.gradle
// ... check ios/Podfile
// ... run react-native link <libraryName>
// ... run pod install
// ... Clean and rebuild the project
```
